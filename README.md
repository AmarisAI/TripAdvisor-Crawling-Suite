# TripAdvisor-Crawler
Not only the abundant travel information, but over 500 million valuable traveller reviews make TripAdvisor one of the most prestigious online travel platforms it is today. Over the past two decades, TripAdvisor has proven itself viable by adopting user-generated content that people throughout the world can refer to. Despite the acquisition of such content is demanding, its potential in a variety of advanced tasks rather than mere interaction is worth investigation. In addition to several constraints, current official APIs only allow limited fields and amount of data on a daily basis, and hence collecting large-scale of comprehensive data in reasonable time seems practically impossible. This project offers a more flexible and yet faster alternative to the official APIs via multi-threading web analysis. The crawling results are stored as raw HTML, from which hotel data, such as hotel name, hotel overall rating, and details of reviews along with reviewers, is subsequently extracted.
